Work In Progress

I got tired of having MP3 files with either missing entries in ID3 tags, no ID3 tag, or inconsistent naming/capitalization/spelling/etc

I wanted something that I can just let lose on my mp3 directory to find and fix these issues, or if its too big an issue, at least let me know where the problems are.


This is that tool, and its 100% incomplete and will change drastically
